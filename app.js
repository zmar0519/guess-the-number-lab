const game = {
    title: 'Guess the Number!',
    biggestNum: 100,
    smallestNum: 1,
    secretNum: null,
    prevGuesses: [], //Step 1
    play: function() {
      this.secretNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 
        (this.biggestNum - this.smallestNum + 1)) + this.smallestNum

  }

//   Completing the following tasks will result in a working *Guess the Number* game:

//   1. Add a `prevGuesses` property to the `game` object initialized to an empty array.
//   2. Add a `getGuess` method to `game` that prompts the player to enter a guess with a message formatted as: *Enter a guess between [smallestNum] and [biggestNum]:*. Hint - use a template literal for the prompt message.
//   3. Ensure that the `getGuess` method returns a value that:
//       - Is a *number*, not a *string*.
//       - Is between `smallestNum` and `biggestNum`, inclusive.
//       - Hints:
//           - This is a great use case for a `while` loop.
//           - `parseInt` returns `NaN` if the string cannot be parsed into a number.
//   4. From within the `play` method, invoke the `getGuess` method from inside a loop, and add the new guess to the `prevGuesses` array.
//       - Hint: this is a great use for a while loop (or even a do...while loop!)
//   5. Add a `render` method to `game` that `play` will call after a guess has been made that alerts:
//       - If the secret has been guessed: `Congrats! You guessed the number in [number of prevGuesses]!`
//       - Otherwise: `Your guess is too [high|low] Previous guesses: x, x, x, x`
//       - Hints:
//           - `render` won’t be able to access any of `play`’s local variables, e.g., `guess`, so be sure pass `render` any arguments as needed (you may have not built your program to use any, that's ok if that's the case!)
//           - Template literals not only have interpolation, but they also honor whitespace - including line breaks!
//           - The list of previous guesses can be generated using the array `join` method.
//   6. The `play` method should end (`return`) when the guess matches `secretNum`.
